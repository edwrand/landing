            <h2 class="text-center text-primary">How does it work?</h2>
            <div class="px-4">
                <p>Many businesses struggle to collect high-quality feedback. Traditional methods involve sending mass
                    survey emails, which only yield responses about 10-30% of the time. That's a lot of customers left
                    out!</p>
                <p>DataGift takes a different approach. Instead of casting a wide net, we target specific customers,
                    creating a marketplace where you buy valuable feedback. For your business, it's about acquiring
                    quality data; for customers, it's a reward for their honest opinions—a win-win.</p>
                <p>As a business you would follow this process:
                    1. Create a detailed survey
                    2. Set a USD reward amount
                    3. Select your target audience
                    4. Launch your survey
                    5. Receive high-quality feedback
                    6. Reward your customers with cash

            <h2 class="text-center text-primary">Example Use Cases</h2>
            <div class="px-4">
                <p>Case 1: SaaS Product Enhancement
                    Company: A B2B software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider that offers project management tools.

                    Problem: The company noticed a decline in customer retention and engagement but couldn’t identify
                    the exact pain points through traditional surveys. Their response rates were low (about 15%),
                    leaving them without actionable feedback.

                    Solution: Using DataGift, they decided to reward customers with $5 for completing a 10-question
                    survey about specific product features and pain points. The company targeted customers who had used
                    the product for at least 6 months and had experienced certain features.

                    Outcome: The survey achieved a 65% response rate, and the data revealed two major usability issues
                    that the company was previously unaware of. With the detailed feedback, they implemented product
                    updates that improved retention by 25% over the following quarter. The $5 incentive made customers
                    feel valued, and many participants continued to engage with the product updates.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Case 2: Retail Product Launch
                    Company: An online clothing retailer planning to launch a new sustainable fashion line.

                    Problem: The retailer needed feedback on customer preferences for colors, designs, and pricing but
                    had struggled to gather meaningful insights from their email list, which typically generated a
                    response rate of 12%.

                    Solution: Through DataGift, the company created a survey targeting previous customers who had shown
                    interest in eco-friendly products. They set a reward of $10 for completing a detailed survey on
                    preferred materials, designs, and pricing structures for their upcoming product line.

                    Outcome: The targeted audience responded enthusiastically, with a 70% response rate. Customers
                    shared valuable feedback, helping the company choose the top 3 most desired product designs and
                    optimal pricing points. As a result, the company launched a collection that sold out within the
                    first two weeks, leading to a 40% increase in revenue from the previous quarter. The incentive
                    strategy made customers feel more engaged and connected to the brand.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Case 3: Hospitality Customer Experience Improvement
                    Company: A luxury hotel chain looking to improve its guest experience, particularly around its spa
                    and wellness services.

                    Problem: The hotel had previously relied on post-stay email surveys, which yielded a low response
                    rate of 18%. They struggled to understand why guests weren’t utilizing the spa services as much as
                    expected.

                    Solution: Through DataGift, the hotel targeted guests who had booked a spa package but didn’t use
                    all the services. They created a detailed survey offering a $20 incentive for participants to share
                    their reasons for not using the spa. This survey specifically targeted guests within 1 month of
                    their stay.

                    Outcome: The hotel saw a 60% response rate, with feedback indicating that many guests found the spa
                    booking process confusing. The hotel made key adjustments to its service flow and saw a 35% increase
                    in spa bookings within the next two months. The incentive built goodwill with their high-value
                    guests, leading to higher loyalty and repeat bookings.</p>

                    <p><strong>2. Cost-Effective Data Collection:</strong> Offering incentives may reduce overall costs

                    <p><strong>4. Broader Demographic Representation:</strong> Paying for feedback attracts a more
                        diverse and representative pool of respondents.</p>
                    <p><strong>5. Strengthening Customer Relationships:</strong> Offering incentives signals that
